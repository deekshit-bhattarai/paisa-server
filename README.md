# Paisa

A simple expense tracker made with DRF and tailwindcss

## Motivation

Having familiarized myself with django's templating, building something that'd work cross platform and returns data in API

## TODO

- [x] Register and Login User
- [x] Dashboard View
- [x] Place to add income and expense
- [x] Filter based on source, category, date and amount type
- [x] All transaction view
- [x] Nicer UI/UX
