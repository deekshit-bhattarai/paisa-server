# Paisa [WIP]

A simple expense tracker made with DRF and tailwindcss

## Motivation

Having familiarized myself with django's templating, building something that'd work cross platform and returns data in API

## TODO

- [ ] Register and Login User
- [ ] Dashboard View
- [ ] Place to add income and expense
- [ ] Filter based on source, category, date and amount type
- [ ] All transaction view
- [ ] Nicer UI/UX
